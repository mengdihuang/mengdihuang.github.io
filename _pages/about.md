I recently earned my master degree in Social Sciences from the University of Chicago, concentrating in psychology. At University of Chicago, I worked with  in <a style = "text-decoration:none" href="https://voices.uchicago.edu/potentialslab/">Professor Fan Yang</a> on a project regarding people's intuitions of meaning and happiness in life. My research interest is in understanding Eudaimonic well-being, including how positive and negative emotions influence perception of life, how to motivate behaviors that produce high efficiency, and how can we foster meaningful relationships with family, friends, and coworkers. I am currently applying to PhD programs in Social Psychology and business schools. 

Prior to University of Chicago, I spent 4 years as an undergraduate in Social Psychology at University of California, San Diego, where I conducted my honors project with <a style = "text-decoration:none" href="https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/FacultyAndResearch/Faculty/FacultyBios/Duke">Dr. Kristen Duke</a> and <a style = "text-decoration:none" href="https://rady.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/amir/">Dr. On Amir</a> on the decaying process of guilt. I was also a research assistant in the <a style = "text-decoration:none" href="http://oveislab.com/">UCSD Emotion Lab</a>, working on projects regarding emotion regulation and empathy.
