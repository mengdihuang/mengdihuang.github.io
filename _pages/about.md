Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D. candidate in social psychology at Northwestern University, where I work with Drs. Wendi Gardner and Daniel Molden. 
<br>
<br>
Broadly speaking, my research focuses on well-being, and I explore it from two main angles. The first line examines the intrapersonal perspective, focusing on how individuals' self-concept influences their decision-making processes and, subsequently, their well-being. The second line of research takes an interpersonal approach, exploring how individuals seek support and navigate conflict within their social networks.

<br>
Before joining Northwestern, I collaborated with <a style = "text-decoration:none" href="https://voices.uchicago.edu/potentialslab/">Dr. Fan Yang</a> at University of Chicago on research examining how individuals evaluate what constitutes a good life. I received my B.S. from UCSD.
