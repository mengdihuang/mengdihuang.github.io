I feel incredibly fortunate to teach and mentor amazing students, learning from them as much as I hope they learn from me. I believe that learning is about more than understanding knowledge; it's about encouraging students to think about and refine their perspectives, as well as their understanding of themselves. My goal is to support each studentâ€™s growth and inspire them on their own journeys of self-actualization, equipping them with the tools they need to think deeply and approach the world with a curious, informed mind.

Currently, at Northwestern University, I serve as a graduate teaching assistant for courses including 
 * Buddhist Psychology
 * Relationship Science
 * Social Psychology
 * Positive Psychology: The Science of Well-Being.

During my undergraduate studies at UCSD, I served as a teaching assistant for Research Methods and the Social Psychology Laboratory, where I helped students design their own psychology experiments and analyze data.
