<h2>Perception of Meaning and Happiness</h2>

<ul>
  <li>What is a meaningful life? Is a meaningful life the same as a happy life? We examined the role of benefits to society and benefits to oneself in peopleâ€™s intuitions of meaning and happiness. We found that people emphasized benefits to society when making judgments about meaning, but consider benefits to society and benefits to oneself equally important when making judgments about happiness. </li>
